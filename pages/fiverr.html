		</div>
		<p>
			Over the course of about two months, I designed numerous different promotional posters and other visual assets for various clients on Fiverr. A select few of the posters that don't appear on my portfolio are displayed here as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wanting to make some pocket money in highschool, I started this gig as a means to do that while sharpening my visual design skills. Unfortunately, the workload quickly got out of hand from the number of incoming requests to the point where it started to interfere with my schoolwork. Regardless, it was enjoyable and rewarding to design for a diverse group of clients, ranging from a fitness club in New Zealand to a clothing brand to a cafe in Romania. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Connecting with all of these people through design was fascinating, and it was great to work with different types of constraints for so many different clients. I'm also looking to pursue more design client work in the future.
