		<h1>WatWhenWhere</h1>
		<p>
			WatWhenWhere is a utility webapp intended to help Waterloo students find common times in their schedules. We've made this easy - all you have to do is paste your term schedule, add your friends, and check your availabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			This app was built in PHP, MySQL, Javascript, CSS and HTML by myself and three friends. I worked on the frontend portion of the app, starting by designing mockups for a mobile-first interface. After a few revisions, I built the frontend statics followed by the functionality. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This was my first real "full" project in the sense in that, over a short period of about two weeks, I saw the app go from a simple idea to a complete, usable webapp that gathered over 120 users within the first few days of release.
