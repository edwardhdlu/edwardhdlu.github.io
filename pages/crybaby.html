		<h1>CryBaby</h1>
		<p>
			CryBaby is an app that assists new parents by providing information to help them respond to their baby's needs. The app features a thermometer interface, where a user can adjust a slider to match their baby's measured temperature. The app then informs them whether that temperature is within a healthy range. Another view includes samples of crying sounds caused by different reasons: hunger, discomfort, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			This app was built first as a one-page webapp using jQuery, then ported to iOS and Android using Cordova.
