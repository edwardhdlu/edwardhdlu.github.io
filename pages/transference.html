		<h1>Transference</h1>
		<p>
			I was asked to make two promotional movie posters for <i>Transference</i>, a sci-fi/thriller short film by High Rise Studio. After watching the short, I did my best to capture the feel of it and incorporate that into the posters.
		</p>
		<p>
			A significant part of this project was working with stock photos, which were provided to me by the studio. Posters I've made on previous occassions have all been centred on type, so it was refreshing to try and integrate the television, characters' faces, backdrops and the lightbulb motif with the rest of the design.
