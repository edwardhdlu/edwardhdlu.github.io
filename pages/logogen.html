		<h1>Logo Generator</h1>
		<p>
			This is a small script I wrote using Processing.js for my highschool as part of an effort to develop a unique and modern visual identity for it. This idea was introduced to me by my good friend <a target="_blank" href="http://lucascherkewski.com">Lucas</a>, and was inspired by our highschool's unique square and rectangular window patterns that exist in its major stairwells.
		</p>
		<p>
			The script randomly generates a square logo with a random number of squares and rectangles, which can be adjusted by changing weight values. Each of the three colours-red, white and blue-is an official school colour and represents the different aspects of school life: academics, activities and athletics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dynamically generated visuals with a randomization factor is a pretty interesting concept. Every newly generated logo looks both visually consistent with the rest and different in shape or colour. I'll definitely be trying this idea some time down the line when I run into another branding challenge.
