		<h1>Predictable</h1>
		<p>
			Predictable is a simple Rails web app modelled around predictions, including features such as posts that expire at a set date and voting that is affected by when the vote occurs relative to the expiry date.
		</p>
		<p>
			So say you're <i>pretty sure</i> that it'll snow next week, even though it's May and no one believes you. Then next week rolls around and, lo and behold, it's snowing. People make some pretty bold predictions, and I thought it might be interesting to have a means to keep score of how often people are right.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of this project for me was to learn Ruby on Rails, which currently seems to be quite a popular framework for building web applications. Through building Predictable, I've become more comfortable with the MVC design pattern and what each of those pieces work together to build a fully functional application.
