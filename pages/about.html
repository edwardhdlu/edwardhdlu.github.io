		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			Hey! I'm a second year Honours Computer Science at the University of Waterloo with a passion for all things tech and design related. I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my life, but frontend development and design are two things I've come to love, and I'm looking to refine my skills in those areas while developing new ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			I try to learn something new every week. My current skillset, or at least the things I consider myself comfortable with, include: <br>
			Design: { Photoshop, Illustrator } <br>
			Languages: { HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, C++, Python, Ruby } <br>
			Frameworks and Tools: { Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Ruby on Rails }<br>
			I'm always looking to add more to the list.
