		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			Hey there! I'm a second year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for all things tech, data and design related. I'm currently seeking software opportunities in machine learning as I love translating mathematical theory directly into practical applications. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For data science, I've done work in Python and C++ with TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe, R, and an array of other libraries for web scraping, testing, etc. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For the web, I've done full stack development with an emphasis on frontend. I'm proficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery and experienced with React, Redux, Node, Express, Socket, Rails, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Mongo.
		</p>
		<p>
			For design, I work primarily in Photoshop and Illustrator. I also enjoy typography and hand lettering.
