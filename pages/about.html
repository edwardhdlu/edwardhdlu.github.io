		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			Hey there! I'm a third year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo interested in machine learning and its applications in processing language, image and financial data. I'm currently looking for intern positions that involve solving engineering problems to deploy models in production or assisting in research that explores new models and techniques.
